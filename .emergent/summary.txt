The previous AI engineer initiated the Toria mobile app development, progressing from initial setup to a partially functional frontend and fully functional backend. Key challenges involved integrating an LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash), setting up Firebase Authentication, and handling complex React Native UI/UX. The navigation architecture was a recurring problem, initially implemented with React Navigation, then refactored to Expo Router's file-based system after testing revealed conflicts. Displaying Instagram reels also posed an issue, transitioning from  embeds to a native-style card design. Despite resolving several critical frontend bugs, a comprehensive QA report highlighted numerous missing features, including authentication flows, complete Plan tab functionality, chatbot integration, and general UI polish. The engineer is now tasked with implementing all remaining features comprehensively and addressing the theme to a brighter UI.

**Toria** aims to solve fragmented travel discovery by providing an Instagram-simple feed for city-specific reels (food + places) and a unified planner to generate personalized travel itineraries using an LLM. The MVP focuses on discovery, planning, and frictionless My Itinerary execution, without payments or bookings. Key goals include increasing decision/planning efficiency, engagement, and retention.

The app consists of three main tabs:
1.  **Discover:** An Instagram-style feed auto-filtered by the user's current city, allowing upvoting, saving, and adding reels to new or existing Day Plans. Instagram reels and posts are displayed using embedded code or native-style cards.
2.  **Plan:** A unified interface for users to input mandatory preferences (Place(s), Going With, Focus) and optional filters, generating either Toria Recommended itineraries or allowing users to Build Your Day manually. This leverages a Python-based LLM microservice (, ) with structured JSON outputs.
3.  **Profile:** A hub for Saved/Favorite Reels, My Day Plans (Current/Upcoming/Past), My Content & Stats, and Settings.

Additional features include Firebase Authentication for secure login/signup, Firebase Analytics, a Start My Day execution view with multi-stop routing and feedback, a Travel Buddy chatbot, and a Notification microservice. The UI/UX emphasizes responsiveness, modern design, and graceful handling of states, with a focus on performance, scalability, and accessibility.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has made significant progress in establishing the core architecture of the Toria application. The backend is fully functional, capable of interacting with MongoDB and integrating with the Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM for itinerary generation, with necessary dependencies installed and environment variables configured.

On the frontend, the app structure has been refactored to correctly use Expo Router for file-based navigation, with three main tabs: Discover, Plan, and Profile. A robust authentication system, including , , , , , and , has been recently implemented. The  file now correctly manages the authentication flow, ensuring users are directed to login/signup if unauthenticated.

The Discover tab () has been fixed to resolve React Hooks violations and now displays native-style reel cards () instead of problematic WebViews, with the Toria logo prominently integrated. Basic UI for the Plan and Profile tabs is in place.

However, a persistent Plan tab navigation issue has been noted but not fully resolved. The user has explicitly requested to implement *all* remaining features comprehensively and to change the app's theme to a brighter, more attractive UI. The engineer is currently in the process of building out the Plan tab, having recently created , , and , alongside updating the  service and adding  and .
